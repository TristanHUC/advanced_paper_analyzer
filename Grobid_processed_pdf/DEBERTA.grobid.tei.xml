<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Recent progress in pre-trained neural language models has significantly improved the performance of many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. In this paper we propose a new model architecture DeBERTa (Decoding-enhanced BERT with disentangled attention) that improves the BERT and RoBERTa models using two novel techniques. The first is the disentangled attention mechanism, where each word is represented using two vectors that encode its content and position, respectively, and the attention weights among words are computed using disentangled matrices on their contents and relative positions, respectively. Second, an enhanced mask decoder is used to incorporate absolute positions in the decoding layer to predict the masked tokens in model pre-training. In addition, a new virtual adversarial training method is used for fine-tuning to improve models' generalization. We show that these techniques significantly improve the efficiency of model pre-training and the performance of both natural language understand (NLU) and natural langauge generation (NLG) downstream tasks. Compared to RoBERTa-Large, a DeBERTa model trained on half of the training data performs consistently better on a wide range of NLP tasks, achieving improvements on MNLI by +0.9% (90.2% vs. 91.1%), on SQuAD v2.0 by +2.3% (88.4% vs. 90.7%) and RACE by +3.6% (83.2% vs. 86.8%). Notably, we scale up DeBERTa by training a larger version that consists of 48 Transform layers with 1.5 billion parameters. The significant performance boost makes the single DeBERTa model surpass the human performance on the SuperGLUE benchmark (Wang et al.,  2019a)  for the first time in terms of macro-average score (89.9 versus 89.8), and the ensemble DeBERTa model sits atop the SuperGLUE leaderboard as of January 6, 2021, outperforming the human baseline by a decent margin (90.3 versus 89.8). The pre-trained DeBERTa models and the source code were released at: https://github.com/microsoft/DeBERTa 1 .</p></div>

Unlike recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that process text in sequence, Transformers apply self-attention to compute in parallel every word from the input text an attention weight that gauges the influence each word has on another, thus allowing for much more parallelization than RNNs for large-scale model training <ref type="bibr" coords="1,257.37,611.65,86.14,8.64" target="#b54">(Vaswani et al., 2017)</ref>.

This is equivalent to computing the attention weights using only the content-to-content and content-toposition terms in equation 2. We argue that the position-to-content term is also important since the attention weight of a word pair depends not only on their contents but on their relative positions, which can only be fully modeled using both the content-to-position and position-to-content terms.

However, taking content-to-position as an example, we note that since δpi, jq P r0, 2kq and the embeddings of all possible relative positions are always a subset of K r P R 2kˆd , then we can reuse K r in the attention calculation for all the queries.</p><p>In our experiments, we set the maximum relative distance k to 512 for pre-training. The disentangled attention weights can be computed efficiently using Algorithm 1. Let δ be the relative position matrix according to equation 3, i.e., δri, js " δpi, jq. Instead of allocating a different relative position embedding matrix for each query, we multiply each query vector Q c ri, :s by K r P R dˆ2k , as in line 3 ´5. Then, we extract the attention weight using the relative position matrix δ as the index, as in line 6 ´10. To compute the position-to-content attention score, we calculate ÃpÑc r:, js, i.e., the column vector of the attention matrix ÃpÑc , by multiplying each key vector K c rj, :s by Q r , as in line 11 ´13. Finally, we extract the corresponding attention score via the relative position matrix δ as the index, as in line 14 ´18. In this way, we do not need to allocate memory to store a relative position embedding for each query and thus reduce the space complexity to Opkdq (for storing K r and Q r ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">ENHANCED MASK DECODER ACCOUNTS FOR ABSOLUTE WORD POSITIONS</head><p>DeBERTa is pretrained using MLM, where a model is trained to use the words surrounding a mask token to predict what the masked word should be. DeBERTa uses the content and position information of the context words for MLM. The disentangled attention mechanism already considers the contents and relative positions of the context words, but not the absolute positions of these words, which in many cases are crucial for the prediction.</p><p>Given a sentence "a new store opened beside the new mall" with the words "store" and "mall" masked for prediction. Using only the local context (e.g., relative positions and surrounding words) is insufficient for the model to distinguish store and mall in this sentence, since both follow the word new with the same relative positions. To address this limitation, the model needs to take into account absolute positions, as complement information to the relative positions. For example, the subject of the sentence is "store" not "mall". These syntactical nuances depend, to a large degree, upon the words' absolute positions in the sentence.</p><p>There are two methods of incorporating absolute positions. The BERT model incorporates absolute positions in the input layer. In DeBERTa, we incorporate them right after all the Transformer layers but before the softmax layer for masked token prediction, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,407.42,448.73,3.66,8.64">2</ref>. In this way, DeBERTa captures the relative positions in all the Transformer layers and only uses absolute positions as complementary information when decoding the masked words. Thus, we call DeBERTa's decoding component an Enhanced Mask Decoder (EMD). In the empirical study, we compare these two methods of incorporating absolute positions and observe that EMD works much better. We conjecture that the early incorporation of absolute positions used by BERT might undesirably hamper the model from learning sufficient information of relative positions. In addition, EMD also enables us to introduce other useful information, in addition to positions, for pre-training. We leave it to future work.</p></div>

It does so by improving a model's robustness to adversarial examples, which are created by making small perturbations to the input. The model is regularized so that when given a task-specific example, the model produces the same output distribution as it produces on an adversarial perturbation of that example.</p><p>For NLP tasks, the perturbation is applied to the word embedding instead of the original word sequence. However, the value ranges (norms) of the embedding vectors vary among different words and models. The variance gets larger for bigger models with billions of parameters, leading to some instability of adversarial training.</p><p>Inspired by layer normalization <ref type="bibr" coords="6,236.96,85.34,63.19,8.64" target="#b0">(Ba et al., 2016)</ref>, we propose the SiFT algorithm that improves the training stability by applying the perturbations to the normalized word embeddings. Specifically, when fine-tuning DeBERTa to a downstream NLP task in our experiments, SiFT first normalizes the word embedding vectors into stochastic vectors, and then applies the perturbation to the normalized embedding vectors. We find that the normalization substantially improves the performance of the fine-tuned models. The improvement is more prominent for larger DeBERTa models. Note that we only apply SiFT to DeBERTa 1.5B on SuperGLUE tasks in our experiments and we will provide a more comprehensive study of SiFT in our future work.</p></div>

Then, we study the convergence property to characterize the model training efficiency. We run experiments for analysis using the base model setting: a model is pre-trained using the Wikipedia + Bookcorpus dataset for 1M steps with batch size 256 in 7 days on a DGX-2 machine with 16 V-100 GPUs. Due to space limit, we visualize the different attention patterns of DeBERTa and RoBERTa in Appendix A.7.</p></div>

The re-pretrained RoBERTa model is denoted as RoBERTa-ReImp base . To investigate the relative contributions of different components in DeBERTa, we develop three variations:</p><p>• -EMD is the DeBERTa base model without EMD.</p><p>• -C2P is the DeBERTa base model without the content-to-position term ((c) in Eq. 4).</p><p>• -P2C is the DeBERTa base model without the position-to-content term ((b) in Eq. 4). As XLNet also uses the relative position bias, this model is close to XLNet plus EMD. ) on MNLI-m/mm, respectively. Similarly, removing either content-to-position or position-to-content leads to inferior performance in all the benchmarks. As expected, removing two components results in even more substantial loss in performance.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>This paper presents a new model architecture DeBERTa (Decoding-enhanced BERT with disentangled attention) that improves the BERT and RoBERTa models using two novel techniques. The first is the disentangled attention mechanism, where each word is represented using two vectors that encode its content and position, respectively, and the attention weights among words are computed using disentangled matrices on their contents and relative positions, respectively. The second is an enhanced mask decoder which incorporates absolute positions in the decoding layer to predict the masked tokens in model pre-training. In addition, a new virtual adversarial training method is used for fine-tuning to improve model's generalization on downstream tasks.</p><p>We show through a comprehensive empirical study that these techniques significantly improve the efficiency of model pre-training and the performance of downstream tasks. The DeBERTa model with 1.5 billion parameters surpasses the human performance on the SuperGLUE benchmark for the first time in terms of macro-average score.</p><p>DeBERTa surpassing human performance on SuperGLUE marks an important milestone toward general AI. Despite its promising results on SuperGLUE, the model is by no means reaching the human-level intelligence of NLU. Humans are extremely good at leveraging the knowledge learned from different tasks to solve a new task with no or little task-specific demonstration. This is referred to as compositional generalization, the ability to generalize to novel compositions (new tasks) of familiar constituents (subtasks or basic problem-solving skills). Moving forward, it is worth exploring how to make DeBERTa incorporate compositional structures in a more explicit manner, which could allow combining neural and symbolic computation of natural language similar to what humans do.</p></div>

However, by sharing the projection matrix between content and position embedding, i.e. W q,r " W q,c , W k,r " W k,c , the number of parameters of DeBERTa is the same as RoBERTa.

Compared with BERT or RoBERTa, this increases the computational cost by 30%. Compared with XLNet which also uses relative position embedding, the increase of computational cost is about 15%. A further optimization by fusing the attention computation kernel can significantly reduce this additional cost. For EM D, since the decoder in pre-training only reconstructs the masked tokens, it does not introduce additional computational cost for unmasked tokens. In the situation where 15% tokens are masked and we use only two decoder layers, the additional cost is 0.15 ˆ2{L which results in an additional computational cost of only 3% for base model(L " 12) and 2% for large model(L " 24) in EMD.</p></div>

The n layers can share the same weight. In our experiment we share the same weight for n " 2 layers to reduce the number of parameters and use absolute position embedding as I of the first EMD layer.

Note that missing results in literature are signified by "-".In addition to GLUE, DeBERTa is evaluated on three categories of NLU benchmarks: (1) Question Answering: SQuAD v1.1<ref type="bibr" coords="7,210.69,279.16,90.53,8.64" target="#b43">(Rajpurkar et al., 2016)</ref>, SQuAD v2.0<ref type="bibr" coords="7,361.94,279.16,90.53,8.64" target="#b44">(Rajpurkar et al., 2018)</ref>, RACE<ref type="bibr" coords="7,487.58,279.16,16.42,8.64;7,108.00,290.12,46.24,8.64" target="#b27">(Lai et al., 2017)</ref>, ReCoRD<ref type="bibr" coords="7,200.49,290.12,79.63,8.64" target="#b62">(Zhang et al., 2018)</ref> and SWAG<ref type="bibr" coords="7,330.19,290.12,80.29,8.64" target="#b61">(Zellers et al., 2018)</ref>; (2) Natural Language Inference: MNLI<ref type="bibr" coords="7,179.91,301.08,88.58,8.64" target="#b59">(Williams et al., 2018)</ref>; and (3) NER: CoNLL-2003. For comparison, we include ALBERT xxlarge<ref type="bibr" coords="7,170.30,312.03,70.06,8.64" target="#b28">(Lan et al., 2019)</ref> 4 and Megatron<ref type="bibr" coords="7,308.23,312.03,87.40,8.64" target="#b49">(Shoeybi et al., 2019)</ref> with three different model sizes, denoted as Megatron 336M , Megatron 1.3B and Megatron 3.9B , respectively, which are trained using the same dataset as RoBERTa. Note that Megatron 336M has a similar model size as other models mentioned above 5 .We summarize the results in Table2. Compared to the previous SOTA PLMs with a similar model size (i.e., BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, ALBERT large , and Megatron 336M ), DeBERTa shows superior performance in all seven tasks. Taking the RACE benchmark as an example, DeBERTa significantly outperforms XLNet by +1.4% (86.8% vs. 85.4%). Although Megatron 1.3B is three times larger than DeBERTa, DeBERTa outperforms it in three of the four benchmarks. We further report DeBERTa on text generation tasks in Appendix A.4. We use 4 DGX-2 with 64 V100 GPUs to train the base model. It takes 10 days to finish a single pre-training of 1M training steps with batch size 2048. We train DeBERTa using the same 78G dataset, and compare it to RoBERTa and XLNet trained on 160G text data.We summarize the base model results in Table3. Across all three tasks, DeBERTa consistently outperforms RoBERTa and XLNet by a larger margin than that in large models. For example, on MNLI-m, DeBERTa base obtains +1.2% (88.8% vs. 87.6%) over RoBERTa base , and +2% (88.8% vs. 86.8%) over XLNet base .</figDesc><table coords="6,107.64,632.28,397.60,41.51"><row><cell>of eight tasks.

We list the detailed hyperparameters of pre-training in Table <ref type="table" coords="16,322.20,432.53,3.77,8.64">8</ref>.

For fine-tuning, we train each task with a hyper-parameter search procedure, each run takes about 1-2 hours on a DGX-2 node. All the hyper-parameters are presented in Table <ref type="table" coords="16,402.89,487.33,3.76,8.64">9</ref>. The model selection is based on the performance on the task-specific development sets.</p><p>Our code is implemented based on Huggingface Transformers 11 , FairSeq 12 and Megatron <ref type="bibr" coords="16,468.03,515.22,35.97,8.64;16,108.00,526.18,47.59,8.64" target="#b49">(Shoeybi et al., 2019)</ref>  13 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.3.1 PRE-TRAINING EFFICIENCY</head><p>To investigate the efficiency of model pre-training, we plot the performance of the fine-tuned model on downstream tasks as a function of the number of pre-training steps. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="16,481.97,581.92,3.81,8.64">1</ref>, for RoBERTa-ReImp base and DeBERTa base , we dump a checkpoint every 150K pre-training steps, and then fine-tune the checkpoint on two representative downstream tasks, MNLI and SQuAD v2.0, and then report the accuracy and F1 score, respectively. As a reference, we also report the final model performance of both the original RoBERTa base <ref type="bibr" coords="16,295.46,625.75,70.47,8.64">(Liu et al., 2019c)</ref> and XLNet base <ref type="bibr" coords="16,430.56,625.75,70.97,8.64" target="#b60">(Yang et al., 2019)</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.4 MAIN RESULTS ON GENERATION TASKS</head><p>In addition to NLU tasks, DeBERTa can also be extended to handle NLG tasks. To allow DeBERTa operating like an auto-regressive model for text generation, we use a triangular matrix for selfattention and set the upper triangular part of the self-attention mask to ´8, following <ref type="bibr" coords="18,460.53,129.89,45.21,8.64;18,107.67,140.85,24.90,8.64" target="#b15">Dong et al. (2019)</ref>.</p><p>We evaluate DeBERTa on the task of auto-regressive language model (ARLM) using Wikitext-103 <ref type="bibr" coords="18,124.81,168.74,79.27,8.64" target="#b37">(Merity et al., 2016)</ref>. To do so, we train a new version of DeBERTa, denoted as DeBERTa-MT.</p><p>It is jointly pre-trained using the MLM and ARLM tasks as in UniLM <ref type="bibr" coords="18,402.11,179.70,76.84,8.64" target="#b15">(Dong et al., 2019)</ref> Table <ref type="table" coords="18,131.35,344.03,9.76,8.64">10</ref> summarizes the results on Wikitext-103. We see that DeBERTa base obtains lower perplexities on both dev and test data, and joint training using MLM and ARLM reduces perplexity further. That DeBERTa-AP is inferior to DeBERTa indicates that it is more effective to incorporate absolute position embeddings of words in the decoding layer as the EMD in DeBERTa than in the input layer as RoBERTa.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.5 HANDLING LONG SEQUENCE INPUT</head><p>With relative position bias, we choose to truncate the maximum relative distance to k as in equation 3.</p><p>Thus in each layer, each token can attend directly to at most 2pk ´1q tokens and itself. By stacking Transformer layers, each token in the l´th layer can attend to at most p2k ´1ql tokens implicitly.</p><p>Taking DeBERTa large as an example, where k " 512, L " 24, in theory, the maximum sequence length that can be handled is 24,528. This is a byproduct benefit of our design choice and we find it beneficial for the RACE task. A comparison of long sequence effect on the RACE task is shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="18,132.07,506.53,8.30,8.64">11</ref>. Long sequence handling is an active research area.

One of our future research directions is to extend DeBERTa to deal with extremely long sequences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.6 PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS OF DIFFERENT MODEL SCALES</head><p>In this subsection, we study the effect of different model sizes applied to large models on GLUE.   We observe two differences. First, RoBERTa has a clear diagonal line effect for a token attending to itself. But this effect is not very visible in DeBERTa. This can be attributed to the use of EMD, in which the absolute position embedding is added to the hidden state of content as the query vector, as verified by the attention pattern of DeBERTa-EMD where the diagonal line effect is more visible than that of the original DeBERTa. Second, we observe vertical strips in the attention patterns of RoBERTa, which are mainly caused by high-frequent functional words or tokens (e.g., "a", "the", and punctuation). For DeBERTa, the strip only appears in the first column, which represents the [CLS] token. We conjecture that a dominant emphasis on [CLS] is desirable since the feature vector of [CLS] is often used as a contextual representation of the entire input sequence in downstream tasks. We also observe that the vertical strip effect is quite obvious in the patterns of the three DeBERTa variants.</p><p>We present three additional examples to illustrate the different attention patterns of DeBERTa and RoBERTa in Figures <ref type="figure" coords="20,193.23,627.78,4.98,8.64">4</ref> and<ref type="figure" coords="20,217.58,627.78,3.74,8.64">5</ref>.</p></div>			</div>
